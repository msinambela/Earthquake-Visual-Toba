Earthquakes are natural phenomena that occur when the Earth's tectonic plates move and release energy.  Big Data's emergent epistemological and research paradigms, as well as data science, an increasingly integrated field of data research, are opening up new opportunities. Visualizing earthquake data is all about understanding earthquake characteristics such as size, location and depth. The result show that September was the quietest month in terms of earthquakes, and in this graph we can see the number of earthquakes for each month in 2022. The month of October is the one that has the highest number of earthquakes. We can see the average depth and magnitude of each year on the bubble chart. In addition, the size and color of the bubbles indicate the number of earthquakes that month. In general, most of the earthquakes occurred in the shallow earthquake range and the 1.8-3.85 magnitude range
